# Hi I'm Zach
I'm currently trying to learn how to program, doing just about anything that interests me. I run a media company called Stultus Studios that focuses on experimentation.


### Current Interests: 
* Web Development using Flask
* Game Development using Unity, Pygame, and Godot


### Current Programming Projects:
* **Electric Tavern**, a browser-based, idle-esque game where you get to know and build friendships with the patrons of a tavern
* **instrud LIVE** - A livestream built around experimentation with live technology, interactivity, and emerging technologies

### Current Non-Programming Related Projects:
* **instrud** - A web show for learning new skills
* **Lemonpaw** - A band spanning multiple musical projects
	* Pink Plato - AV Band with a focus on complex integration of visuals with audio
	* Songs for Losers - Reimagining of popular songs with a more personal touch from myself
